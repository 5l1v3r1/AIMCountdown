AIMCountdown
============

This is an annoying Python script which can message an AIM user periodically counting down to a specific time of the day. This is especially useful for spamming people at work, reminding them ever so cruelly how much time there is until they get to leave.

Dependencies
============

AIMCountdown depends on python-purple for AIM integration.
